About
-----

This code is a Fortran/Python implementation of Marston's "Fourier Grid
Hamiltonian" as described in D. Tannor's book "Introduction to Quantum
Mechanics: a time-dependent perspective". This method allows the computation
of quantum eigenstates of bound 1d systems.

Usage
-----

The Hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized is computed by a Fortran routine
(double loop!). The routine can be compiled to a Python extension using
``f2py`` (command given in the source). The potential definition, sampling,
diagonalisation and plotting is performed in the Python script ``FGH.py``.
